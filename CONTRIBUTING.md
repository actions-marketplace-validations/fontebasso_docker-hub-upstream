# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Docker Hub Upstream!

We welcome and appreciate any help, feedback, or suggestions you can provide. Here are some guidelines to get started:

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Make your changes on a separate branch. Please follow our [branch naming conventions](#branch-naming) and make sure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch.
4. Test your changes thoroughly.
5. Submit a pull request (PR) and provide a clear description of your changes. Make sure to reference any relevant issues or pull requests.

## Guidelines

- Follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.
- Make sure your code follows the project's existing style and formatting.
- Write clear, concise, and helpful commit messages. See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) for more information.
- Make sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
- Document any new features or changes in the project's [README.md](README.md) file.
- Be patient and respectful of others. We're all here to learn and improve.

## Branch Naming

Please name your branch using the following format:

```
[issue number]-[short description]
```

For example, if you're working on issue #123 and adding a new feature, your branch name would be:

```
123-add-new-feature
```
